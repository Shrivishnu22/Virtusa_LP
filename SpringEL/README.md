# Spring Example - Spring Expression Language (SpEL)

> Spring Expression Language
- It is a powerful tool that allows developers to write complex expressions in a concise and readable way.
- This can be very useful in situations where the value of a property or a method call needs to be determined at runtime
- Expressions are enclosed in "#{...}" and can use a variety of operators, such as mathematical, logical, and relational operators, as well as access to properties, methods, and arrays

> Example
- #{T(java.lang.Math).random()}  --> The "T" in the code is short for "Type" and is used to access static fields and methods of a class
